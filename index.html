<h1>Finally working with curiosity as a developer!</h1>
<p><b>Being</b> self taught programmer for about 6 months has been time, energy and resource draining as bugs will never let it go smoothly. <br>When this golden opportunity reached me, <strong>fighting bugs from personal project almost pull me out.</strong> <small>smiles</small><br>Now, one might ask why I choose to work with curiosity <big>Reason is for greater impact in the world of programming, to learn and advance the right way too</big></p>
<h2>Congratulations to me!</h2>
